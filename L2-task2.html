            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India (2002-2007). Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his role in developing India's ballistic missile and nuclear programs, he played a crucial part in the success of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Prior to his presidency, he worked at ISRO and DRDO, contributing to India’s space and defense capabilities. As President, Kalam was beloved for his humility and vision, earning the title "People’s President". After his presidency, he dedicated his life to teaching, inspiring millions, especially students, with his vision for India’s development, which he articulated in his book "India 2020". He passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong. His legacy is one of simplicity, inspiration, and a deep commitment to science and education.
